# TSP Genetic Algorithm

This project utilizes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP involves finding the most efficient route that visits a set of cities exactly once and returns to the starting city, minimizing the total distance traveled..

## Features

- **Genetic Algorithm:** Utilizes a genetic algorithm to evolve and optimize possible solutions for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).
- **Greedy Algorithm:** Implements a greedy algorithm to find near-optimal solutions for the TSP, considering different starting cities. 
- **Random Algorithm:** Compares the performance of the genetic algorithm with a random algorithm that selects starting cities randomly. 
- **Efficient Route:** Finds an optimal or near-optimal solution to the TSP by evolving a population of routes over generations.
- **Customization:** Easily customizable parameters such as population size, mutation rate, and crossover strategy to adapt to different problem instances.
